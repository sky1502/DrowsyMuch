DrowsyMuch
A repo for playing with dlib eye detection with and without using CNN

Prerequisites:
1. dlib installed
2. imutils installed
3. keras and tensorflow 2.2+ for drowsiness detector v2 for training the model
4. python 3+

Download the model for face detection from here: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 

Put this model in the Drowsiness Detector or Drowsiness Detector v2 folder and rename it to "predictor.dat" and you are good to go.
